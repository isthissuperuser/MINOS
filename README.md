# MINOSSE
**MINOSSE** (MINOS in english, name inspired by the famous character in Dante's work) is a web-based, client-server application for electronic voting, real-time data collection and counting, and multi-candidate elections.

It uses the [Paillier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem) semi-homomorphic cryptographic scheme to anonymously collect and count the votes.

It is a purely *demonstrative* application and shouldn't be employed in a production environment by **any means**.
